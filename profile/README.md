# Welcome to ZIMO's site on GitHub

[ZIMO Elektronik](http://zimo.at) is a manufacturer of digital components for model railways based in Vienna, Austria. Since it was founded 40 years ago, ZIMO's software stack has always been written by passionate developers who love to tinker with their products. Now we want to give others the opportunity to do the same and have therefore decided to release parts of our software under permissive licenses.

Below you can find a selection of ZIMO's open-source projects. Our full repository list can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/ZIMO-Elektronik/repositories).
